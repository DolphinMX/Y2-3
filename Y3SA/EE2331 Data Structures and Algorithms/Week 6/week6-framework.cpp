/* 
   In this week's tutorial, you need to practice recursive programming. The detailed tasks can be found in the following framework. Feel free to reuse the codes from the previous tutorials

//include needed head files and libraries


/*
  three functions here: insertion sort, binarySearch1, and binarySearch2

 */

main(...)
{
  //ask the user to input an integer n


  //generate n random numbers


  //call insertion sort and sort the n random numbers
  //insertionSort(...)

  //ask the user to input a query (an integer)

  //call the first function of binary search using loop/iterative implementation
  //binarySearch1(...);
  //print out the search result: not found or the index of the found item


  //call the second function of binary search (recursive implementation)
  //binarySearch2(....);
  //print out the search results: not found or the index of the found item
  
}
